## Howto compile for different platforms

WIP. These notes are just for myself for now.

* Do changes for Raylib source according to [raylib_changes.txt](raylib_changes.txt)

* Then compile raylib for your platform

* Copy the libraylib.a into lib\platform

* Copy raylib.h to include

Make sure CMake builds the game for your platform. Right now it's setup for windows only
